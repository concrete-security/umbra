A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of a main processor. It helps the code and data loaded inside it be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. Data confidentiality prevents unauthorized entities from outside the TEE from reading data, while code integrity prevents code in the TEE from being replaced or modified by unauthorized entities, which may also be the computer owner itself as in certain DRM schemes described in Intel SGX.

This is done by implementing unique, immutable, and confidential architectural security, which offers hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code and data in memory. This allows user-level code to allocate private regions of memory, called enclaves, which are designed to be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels.[1][2][3] A TEE as an isolated execution environment provides security features such as isolated execution, integrity of applications executing with the TEE, and confidentiality of their assets. In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security for trusted applications running on the device than a rich operating system (OS) and more functionality than a 'secure element' (SE).
